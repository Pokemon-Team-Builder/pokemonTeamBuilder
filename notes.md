Where are we at?

1. Page Load - localhost:3000
  * Initial render of Pokemon types (nav bar)
  * Click on type to render unique Pokemon below

2. When Pokemon render
  * Present "add to my pokemon" and "details" options with buttons or the like
  * Should we expand view details or will it be within the same container
  * Maybe a modal for view details

3. When "add to my pokemon" is selected, favorites
   will render directly below header for easy view
   * Start with remove option for my pokemon

4.
